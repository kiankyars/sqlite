# SQLite Agent Prompt

You are building an embedded SQLite-like database engine in Rust.

## Workflow

1. Orient first:
- Read `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, and relevant `notes/`.
- Check `current_tasks/` for active locks. Do not work on a task that is already locked.

2. Claim one task:
- Pick the highest-priority unlocked task from `PROGRESS.md`.
- Create `current_tasks/<task_name>.txt`.
- Commit and push the lock before implementation.

3. Implement in small, testable increments. Do not delete or rewrite another agent's code without reading `notes/` first.

4. Test before push:
- Run `./test.sh --fast` before each push.
- If behavior changes, add tests in the same commit.
- Use `sqlite3` as behavioral oracle for SQL semantics/results; normalize when comparing so tests are stable.
- Keep internal storage/engine invariants owned by this repo's design.

5. Update shared state:
- Update `PROGRESS.md` when finishing a task: what you did, current test pass rate, what should be done next.
- Add important handoff notes in `notes/<topic>.md`.
- Update `README.md` or `DESIGN.md` only if implementation reality changes; keep updates minimal and in the same commit as related code changes.

6. Clean up:
- Remove your lock file when done.
- Pull/rebase and push cleanly. If you hit a merge conflict, resolve carefully; read the other agent's changes before resolving.

## Constraints

- Follow best-practice stale-lock handling.
- If you remove stale locks, include that cleanup in a commit and push.
- Keep changes scoped.
- Do not push regressions.
- Avoid `unsafe` unless documented and justified in `DESIGN.md`.
- If stuck on a bug, document what you tried in `notes/` and move on.

**Acknowledging task and planning first step**
codex
I’ll follow the SQLite workflow exactly: first I’m going to read `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `notes/`, and `current_tasks/` to identify the highest-priority unlocked task and confirm lock state before making any edits.

**Inspecting lock and task files**
codex
I found an active lock file already in `current_tasks/`. Next I’m reading the core docs and lock details to determine whether that lock is stale and which unlocked task is currently highest priority.

### Module Responsibilities

**ralph-parser** — SQL text in, AST out.
- Tokenizer: produces a stream of typed tokens from raw SQL.
- Parser: recursive-descent parser consumes tokens, produces AST nodes.
- AST types: `Select`, `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, `CreateTable`, `DropTable`, expressions, column refs, literals, operators.

# ralph-sqlite

A SQLite-compatible database engine built from scratch in Rust.

## Purpose

ralph-sqlite is an educational and experimental implementation of a relational database engine modeled after SQLite. It implements SQL parsing, query planning, execution, and a page-based storage engine with B+tree indexes, transactions, and write-ahead logging.

## Architecture Overview

The project is organized as a Cargo workspace with five crates:

```
crates/
├── parser/        SQL tokenizer, parser, and AST definitions
├── planner/       Logical and physical query plan generation
├── executor/      Volcano-style query execution engine
├── storage/       Pager, B+tree, on-disk format, WAL, transactions
└── ralph-sqlite/  Top-level integration crate
```
 succeeded in 339ms:
# Progress

## Current Status

**Phase: Stage 5 (partial)** — Tokenizer/parser, pager, B+tree, schema table + catalog persistence integration, end-to-end CREATE/INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE/`DROP TABLE`/`DROP INDEX` execution, SELECT `ORDER BY`/`LIMIT`/aggregates/`GROUP BY`/`HAVING`, WAL write-ahead commit path, WAL startup recovery/checkpoint, SQL transaction control (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`), a standalone Volcano executor core (`Scan`/`Filter`/`Project`) with expression evaluation, and query planner index selection (equality + simple range) for SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE are implemented.

Latest completions:
- Full SQL parser with modular tokenizer, AST, and recursive-descent parser (Agent 1)
- Basic pager with buffer pool implemented in `crates/storage` (Agent 2)
- Page allocator with freelist-pop stub implemented in `crates/storage` (Agent 4)
- Pager freelist management API in `crates/storage` (Agent 3) — added `Pager::free_page()` with validation/duplicate detection and allocation-reuse persistence coverage
- B+tree with insert, point lookup, leaf-linked range scan, and splitting (Agent 2)
- Schema table (sqlite_master equivalent) with create/find/list operations (Agent 2)
- End-to-end `CREATE TABLE` + `INSERT` + `SELECT` path in `crates/ralph-sqlite` (Agent 4)
- B+tree delete primitive for UPDATE/DELETE groundwork (Agent 3) — key removal via tree descent to target leaf, with unit tests for single-leaf and split-tree deletes (no rebalance/merge yet)
- End-to-end `UPDATE` + `DELETE` execution in `crates/ralph-sqlite` (Agent codex) — WHERE filtering + assignment evaluation wired to B+tree row updates/deletes, with affected-row counts and integration tests
- Secondary indexes with `CREATE INDEX` execution, backfill, and insert-time maintenance in `crates/ralph-sqlite` (Agent 4)
- WAL write path + commit in `crates/storage` (Agent codex) — WAL sidecar file format, page/commit frames with checksums, and write-ahead commit flow wired into SQL write statements
- SQL transaction control in parser + integration layer (Agent codex) — `BEGIN [TRANSACTION]`, `COMMIT [TRANSACTION]`, `ROLLBACK [TRANSACTION]` parsing/execution with autocommit gating and rollback-to-snapshot behavior for connection-local catalogs
- SELECT `ORDER BY` execution in `crates/ralph-sqlite` (Agent 3) — supports expression sort keys (including non-projected columns), ASC/DESC multi-key ordering, and preserves `LIMIT/OFFSET` after sort

**Reporting work blocked by locks and dirty tree**
codex
I’m blocked and stopped before making changes because I found two coordination issues:

1. There is an active non-stale lock in `current_tasks/btree-delete-interior-occupancy-rebalance.txt` (created at **Wed Feb 11 2026 11:54:19 UTC**, ~4 minutes old).
2. The working tree already has unexpected uncommitted changes I did not make:
- `crates/parser/src/ast.rs`
- `crates/parser/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/parser/src/parser.rs`
- `crates/parser/src/token.rs`
- `crates/parser/src/tokenizer.rs`
- `crates/storage/src/header.rs`

How do you want to proceed:
1. Continue in this dirty tree and treat these changes as intentional context.
2. Switch to another unlocked task and ignore these modified files.
3. Stop and wait for the other agent/changes to be resolved first.
