Task complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary

**Task: UPDATE/DELETE planner-driven index selection**

### Changes made:

1. **`crates/planner/src/lib.rs`** — Added `plan_where(where_clause, table_name, indexes) -> AccessPath`, a general-purpose entry point for planning access paths from arbitrary WHERE clauses (not tied to `SelectStmt`). Added 3 unit tests.

2. **`crates/ralph-sqlite/src/lib.rs`** — Three changes:
   - Added `Database::read_candidate_entries()` helper that uses `AccessPath::IndexEq` to probe a secondary index B+tree for matching rowids, then fetches only those table rows (instead of scanning the whole table)
   - Updated `execute_update()` to call `plan_where()` and use `read_candidate_entries()`
   - Updated `execute_delete()` to call `plan_where()` and use `read_candidate_entries()`
   - Added 3 integration tests covering index-driven UPDATE, index-driven DELETE, and UPDATE that changes the indexed column value

3. **`PROGRESS.md`** — Updated status, test pass rates, completed tasks list, and known issues

4. **`notes/update-delete-index-selection.md`** — Added handoff notes

### Test results:
- **137/137** workspace tests pass (including 6 new tests from this task + 6 from another agent's concurrent schema work)
- **5/5** `test.sh` full pass
- No regressions, merge conflict with concurrent schema work resolved cleanly
